# Autism Support Chatbot

## About Autism

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental condition that affects how individuals perceive and interact with the world around them. It is characterized by challenges with social communication, restricted interests, and repetitive behaviors. Autism is a spectrum disorder, meaning that each individual with autism has a unique set of strengths and challenges. Early intervention and understanding the needs of individuals with autism can significantly improve their quality of life.

### Key Characteristics of Autism:
- Difficulty with social interactions and communication.
- Sensitivity to sensory inputs such as sound, light, or textures.
- Repetitive behaviors or patterns.
- Focused interests or activities.

Autism is not a disease but a different way of experiencing the world. Building awareness and providing the right support can help individuals with autism thrive.

## Challenges Faced by Parents of Autistic Children

Raising a child with autism can be both rewarding and challenging. Parents often encounter unique hurdles while caring for their autistic children. Some of these challenges include:

### 1. Understanding the Diagnosis
Many parents struggle to understand the complexities of autism when their child is diagnosed. Questions like "What does this mean for my child?" and "How severe is their autism?" often arise.

### 2. Communication Barriers
Autistic children may have limited verbal communication, making it challenging for parents to understand their needs, emotions, or discomforts.

### 3. Access to Resources
Parents may find it difficult to locate and access appropriate therapies, educational programs, or specialists tailored to their child’s needs.

### 4. Behavioral Challenges
Managing repetitive behaviors, sensory sensitivities, or meltdowns can be overwhelming. Parents often seek advice on how to handle specific behavioral scenarios.
